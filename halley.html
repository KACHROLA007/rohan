                <p>
                Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially designated 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet visible from
                 Earth every 75–79 years. Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to 
                 the naked eye from Earth, and thus the only naked-eye comet that can appear twice in a human lifetime.
                  Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in 
                 mid-2061.

                <p>

                Halley's periodic returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers 
                around the world since at least 240 BC. But it was not until 1705 that the English astronomer Edmond
                 Halley understood that these appearances were reappearances of the same comet. As a result of this
                  discovery, the comet is named after Halley.

                During its 1986 visit to the inner Solar System, Halley's Comet became the first comet to be observed
                 in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus 
                 and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of 
                 longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipple's "dirty snowball" model
                 , which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices—such as 
                 water, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially 
                 reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley
                  is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.

Halley was the first comet to be recognized as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead that they must follow straight paths through the Solar System.[21]

In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, in which he outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he had suspected that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet),[22] he was unable to completely reconcile comets into his model.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, it was Newton's friend, editor and publisher, Edmond Halley, who, in his 1705 Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, used Newton's new laws to calculate the gravitational effects of Jupiter and Saturn on cometary orbits.[23] Having compiled a list of 24 comet observations, he calculated that the orbital elements of a second comet that had appeared in 1682 were nearly the same as those of two comets that had appeared in 1531 (observed by Petrus Apianus) and 1607 (observed by Johannes Kepler).[23][24] Halley thus concluded that all three comets were, in fact, the same object returning about every 76 years, a period that has since been found to vary between 74 and 79 years. After a rough estimate of the perturbations the comet would sustain from the gravitational attraction of the planets, he predicted its return for 1758.[25] While he had personally observed the comet around perihelion in September 1682,[26] Halley died in 1742 before he could observe its predicted return.[27]

Halley's prediction of the comet's return proved to be correct, although it was not seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days.[28] This effect was computed before its return (with a one-month error to 13 April)[29] by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute.[30] The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It was also one of the earliest successful tests of Newtonian physics, and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power.[31] The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1759.[31]

Some scholars have proposed that first-century Mesopotamian astronomers already had recognized Halley's Comet as periodic.[32] This theory notes a passage in the Babylonian Talmud, tractate Horayot[33] that refers to "a star which appears once in seventy years that makes the captains of the ships err."[34]
