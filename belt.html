The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, located roughly between the
 orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped 
 bodies, of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, called asteroids or minor planets. This 
 asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other
  asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.
</p>
<p>
    The asteroid belt is the smallest and innermost known circumstellar disc in the Solar
     System. About 60% its mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, 
     Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is calculated to be 3% that of 
     the Moon
    </p>
    <p>
        Ceres, the only object in the asteroid belt large enough to be a dwarf planet, is about
         950 km in diameter, whereas Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea have mean diameters less than
          600 km. The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. 
          The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have
           traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids
            occur and can produce an asteroid family, whose members have similar orbital 
            characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are 
            categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: 
            carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).
    </p>
    <p>
        The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals. Planetesimals are
         the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations 
         from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.
         Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets
          shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years
           of 
          the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading
           to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever 
           their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital
         distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.
