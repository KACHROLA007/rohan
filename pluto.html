        Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
        It was the first object discovered in the Kuiper belt, in 1930. It was declared the ninth planet from the Sun, though it was always
        the odd object out. Following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt and scattered disc starting in the 1990s, particularly 
        the more massive dwarf planet Eris, Pluto's status as a planet was increasingly questioned. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union 
        (IAU) formally re-defined the term planet to exclude Pluto, which was classified as a dwarf planet. (Many planetary astronomers, however,
        consider dwarf planets to be a category of planet.)
</p>
<P>
        Pluto is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object
        by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and 
        rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Compared to Earth's moon, Pluto has only one sixth its mass and one third its volume.
</P>
<p>        
        Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8 to
        4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5 AU [5.91 billion km;
        3.67 billion mi]). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance
        prevents them from colliding.
   </p>
   <p>     
        Pluto has five known moons. Charon the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra.
        Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body,
        and they are tidally locked. The New Horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14,
        2015 and taking detailed measurements and observations.
